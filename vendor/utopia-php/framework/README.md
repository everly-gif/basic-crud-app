Utopia Framework is a PHP MVC based framework with minimal must-have features for professional, simple, advanced and secure web development. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Utopia Framework is dependency free. Any extra features such as authentication, caching will be available as standalone models in order to keep the framework core as clean, light any easy to learn.

## Getting Started

Install using composer:
```bash
composer require utopia-php/framework
```

Init your first application:
```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';

use Utopia\App;
use Utopia\Request;
use Utopia\Response;

App::get('/hello-world') // Define Route
    ->inject('request')
    ->inject('response')
    ->action(
        function($request, $response) {
            $response
              ->addHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate')
              ->addHeader('Expires', '0')
              ->addHeader('Pragma', 'no-cache')
              ->json(['Hello' => 'World']);
        }
    );

App::setMode(App::MODE_TYPE_PRODUCTION); // Define Mode

$app        = new App('America/New_York');
$request    = new Request();
$response   = new Response();

$app->run($request, $response);
```

## System Requirements

Utopia Framework requires PHP 7.3 or later. We recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.
